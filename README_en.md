Sound artists John Richards and Tim Shaw from the UK will be visiting Japan this winter. Both of them make DIY musical instruments and devices and are active internationally. <br />
Do a Front have invited two Japanese artists, Tetsuya Umeda (Osaka) and Kanta Horio (Tokyo), to join Richards and Shaw who they have worked with before, to hold a live event-style exhibition with sailing as a motif.<br />
Within the venue, the artists will temporarily open a shop based on the theme of their work, and you will have the opportunity to make or rent a FM radio and then move around the venue while listening to the sounds emitted by the artists. You can also purchase on the spot other works and items produced in the artists’ temporary shops.<br />
Please look forward to the new world premiere of the four internationally active artists!
